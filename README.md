# cic-filter

This is a CIC filter that I implemented in Verilog based on this excellent article written by Rick Lyons: [A Beginner's Guide To Cascaded Integrator-Comb (CIC) Filters](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1337.php)

Included is a Jupyter notebook and a cocotb testbench to analyze the results.
